# Libre Solar Charge Controller Firmware

![build badge](https://travis-ci.com/LibreSolar/charge-controller-firmware.svg?branch=master)

Firmware based on ARM mbed framework for the Libre Solar MPPT/PWM solar charge controllers

## Supported devices

The software is configurable to support different charge controller PCBs with either STM32F072 (including CAN support) or low-power STM32L072/3 MCUs.

- [Libre Solar MPPT 12/24V 20A with CAN (v0.10)](https://github.com/LibreSolar/MPPT-2420-LC)
- [Libre Solar MPPT 12V 10A with USB (v0.2 and v0.4)](https://github.com/LibreSolar/MPPT-1210-HUS)
- [Libre Solar PWM 12/24V 20A](https://github.com/LibreSolar/PWM-2420-LUS)

## Bootloader Support

The custom linker script file need to be updated before generating the application firmware binary. The STM32L073XZ.ld.link_script.ld file is located in the root project directory. For each application, the flash start address and the maximum code size need to be updated in this file. Currently, the locations 0x08001000 and 0x08018000 are used for applications 1 & 2 respectively.

## Building and flashing the firmware

This firmware is developed using the [ARM mbed OS](https://developer.mbed.org/) embedded framework which has easy-to-understand C++ syntax (similar to Arduino) and thus enhances community based software development.

If used together with Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO, starting firmware development is only a matter of a few clicks:

1. Install Visual Studio Code and [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) to build the firmware.

2. Copy `src/config.h_template` to `src/config.h`, and adjust basic settings. `config.h` is ignored by git, so your changes are kept after software updates using `git pull`.

3. Select the correct board in `platformio.ini` by removing the comment before the board name under `[platformio]`

4. Connect the board via a programmer. See the Libre Solar website for [further project-agnostic instructions](http://libre.solar/docs/flashing).

5. Press the upload button at the bottom left corner in VS Code.

### Troubleshooting

#### Errors with STM32L072 MCU using OpenOCD

The standard OpenOCD settings sometimes fail to flash firmware to this MCU, which is used in the MPPT 1210 HUS and the PWM charge controller.

Try one of these workarounds:

1. Change OpenOCD settings to `set WORKAREASIZE 0x1000` in the file `~/.platformio/packages/tool-openocd/scripts/board/st_nucleo_l073rz.cfg`.

2. Use ST-Link tools. For Windows there is a GUI tool. Under Linux, uncomment the `upload_command` line in `platformio.ini`.

3. Use other debuggers and tools, e.g. Segger J-Link.

#### Connection failures

If flashing fails like this in PlatformIO:

```
Error: init mode failed (unable to connect to the target)
in procedure 'program'
** OpenOCD init failed **
shutdown command invoked
```

or with ST-Link:

```bash
$ st-flash write .pio/build/mppt-1210-hus-v0.4/firmware.bin 0x08000000
st-flash 1.5.1
2019-06-21T18:13:03 INFO common.c: Loading device parameters....
2019-06-21T18:13:03 WARN common.c: unknown chip id! 0x5fa0004
```

check the connection between the programmer (for example the ST-Link of the Nucleo board) and the charge controller.

## API documentation

The documentation auto-generated by Doxygen can be found [here](https://libre.solar/charge-controller-firmware/).

## Unit tests

In order to run the unit tests, you need a PlatformIO Plus account. Run tests with the following command:

    platformio test -e unit-test-native
